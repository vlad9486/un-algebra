//! Algebraic _commutative group_ traits and implementations.

//! The `com_group` module provides support for types that form
//! algebraic _comutative groups_ (also called _abelian groups_). It
//! also provides support for types that form _additive_ or
//! _multiplicative_ _commutative groups_, including their "numeric"
//! counterparts.
